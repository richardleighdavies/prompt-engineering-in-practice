User Message: Jake Paul defeated 58-year-old former boxing champion Mike Tyson in an underwhelming fight that lasted eight rounds at AT&T Stadium in Texas. Tyson appeared slow and fatigued, while Paul effectively broke through his defense, improving his record to 11-1. The fight, aired by Netflix as part of its foray into live programming, faced significant technical issues, including buffering and poor picture quality, leading to widespread viewer complaints on social media. Despite the lackluster main event, the star-studded spectacle included celebrity attendees like Shaquille O’Neal and Charlize Theron, promotional tie-ins to Netflix’s content, and a thrilling match between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano.
